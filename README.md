👋 Hi, I'm Rahul Prajapati, a dedicated Computer Engineering student at VIVA Institute of Technology, Virar East. 🎓

💻 As a passionate coder, I wield proficiency in a spectrum of programming languages, including C/C++, Java, Python, R, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and PHP. My expertise extends to frameworks like Django and tools such as Android Studio and Flutter.

🚀 Currently, I'm making waves in the tech world with my innovative projects. One noteworthy creation is a government tender website I developed. This platform facilitates multiple organizations in submitting tenders, employing a meticulous filtering system based on factors like cost, time, and guarantee. The goal is to recommend the best options to the government.

🌐 Additionally, I'm at the forefront of crafting a cutting-edge cross-platform application. This app focuses on railway and bus pass management, where Train Ticket Examiners (TTE) can seamlessly validate users through a QR code scanning feature integrated into the user's app.

🔍 Always eager to embrace new challenges, I am a curious coder with an insatiable appetite for learning. My GitHub is a testament to my commitment to excellence, featuring a diverse range of projects that showcase my versatility and commitment to staying on the pulse of emerging technologies.
